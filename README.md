This is a repository created for internship provided by Ignis Tech Solutions.

## &nbsp; Task
**The assignment goal is to basically make a script to scrape some data from a website and show it on a react based webapp.**

I was Assigned to create a scrapy crawler to scrape data from a given website and then create a home page and product page for the scraped data using `Scrapy, djangorestframework, requests & ReactJs` 


## &nbsp; Screenshots of Data Scraped

The scraped data is grouped based upon their categories as you can see the details and keys below:
